# Add text and media

First things first, add a **text** content block to explain what this StoryMap is about. Highlight your text and experiment with the different styling options. 

Add an **image** from `storymaps-workshop` folder â€” either your own or one provided. Notice you can dictate whether the image sits to the left or right of your text, or takes up the width of the screen. Clicking the gear icon, you can give the image an attribution and alt text. 

Also note that there is a size limit to the media you can upload on the public account. If you plan on uploading a lot of rasters to your Content, you may need to resize them. Additionally, if you have long videos it's recommended you upload them to another platform, like YouTube, and embed them via links. This won't take up any space on your account.

Add any other content blocks you wish. then **add a separator bar**.
