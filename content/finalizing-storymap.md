# Finalizing your StoryMap for Publication
Now its time to add the maps we just created with the online mapping tool to our StoryMap. 

## Add Web Maps to StoryMap
Return to your StoryMap and add a **map** content block. Choose a map you just made.

## Add Swipe
Swipe is not only for images or static maps, but can be used to compare 2 webmaps as well. Swipe is great to show changes over time.

Each map on the swipe is a separate webmap. You will have to create a separate webmap highlighting the features you want to include. For instance, you will have to create a map for 1980s bike routes and one for 2000s bikeroutes. You can easily do this with the filter option on webmaps.



## Publish 
Although in a real-world scenario you may wait until your project is further along before publishing it's first version, let's practice publishing now. (If you don't want to publish your work you can also just preview it to see what it would look like.)
