## Add Web Maps to StoryMap


## Add Swipe
You can use the Swipe to let readers easily compare two maps (webmap or express) or images with an interactive slider. This is great to show changes over time.

Each map on the swipe is a separate webmap. You will have to create a separate webmap highlighting the features you want to include. For instance, you will have to create a map for 1980s bike routes and one for 2000s bikeroutes. You can easily do this with the filter option on webmaps.
