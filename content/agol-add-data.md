# Adding Data

Requires finding data and downloading in proper format, uploading to your ArcGIS Online account, and then vizualizing in mapping platform. 

Data we will work with - commutes. from Vancouver open data portal 

## Find Data 
The [Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/) is an excellent source for a variety of municipal data, including geographic data layers such as point, lines, polygons, and raster images.

As long as the data you are looking at has a geographic element, you can download it as a **GeoJSON** to add as a layer to your ArcGIS Online webmap. Use the export tab to download.

Sample Data
You can download the data below and add each file as a layer to your ArcGIS Online webmap to play around with features.

Vancouver_Commuter_2016.geojson is a polygon layer with commuter data from the 2016 census joined to local area boundaries.

bikeways.geojson is a line layer showing Vancouver bike paths

heritage-sites.geojson is a point layer showing Vancouver heritage sites.




## Add Data from File
Back in the map, On the sidebar on the left, click on Layers, then on click on the drop down arrow next to Add layer to add a layer from a file.

Ensure you export any files from your GIS or download any files you find as GeoJSON.


## Add Data from the Living Atlas

You can also add data from the [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/), a large collection of geographic information compiled and created by Esri.

Click on Layers, then click on the Add button.

From the dropdown arrow next to My Content, select Living Atlas and you can search for layers to add.

*Note: If you only have a public ArcGIS account, you will have access to fewer layers in the Living Atlas.*


## Displaying Layers

ou can add as many layers as you want and they will display simultaneously.

Next to the layer name, you will see an eye and three dots. Click on the eye to make the layer visible or invisible.

If you click on the three dots next to the layer name, you have the following options:

> - Zoom to layer: Will zoom your map to the layer location
> - Show properties: Displays things like symbology
> - Attribute table: Shows the data in a tabular format
> - Rename and Remove
