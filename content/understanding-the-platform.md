# Understanding the ArcGIS Online Platform  

ArcGIS Online is a cloud-based software that allows you to organize and create GIS projects, which can come in the form of story maps, GIS files created with desktop applications, web maps (more on those below), and more. Today's workshop will focus on the StoryMaps application, as well as the Online mapping tool which we will use to make a map which we will then embed in our StoryMap. All the dynamic/interactive maps or static maps --> you have to make yourself. Understanding workflow to upload spatial data into ArcGIS online and create a basic vizualization via webmap is advantantageous skill to have. Again, limited analysis can be done with free account, but enough to get a sense of what platform can and could do for you. 

## ArcGIS Online's [StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)

[ArcGIS StoryMap](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/get-started/what-is-arcgis-storymaps.htm) is a story authoring web-based application that allows you to share your maps in the context of narrative text and other multimedia content. Story Map enables multimedia cartography and allows users to tell a story with interactive map, pictures, videos and texts. It is easy to use and can be used a presentation tool.



## ArcGIS Online's [Webmap](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-web-map.htm)

According to ESRI: “An ArcGIS web map is an interactive display of geographic information that you can use to tell stories and answer questions…Maps contain a basemap, a set of data layers (many of which include interactive pop-up windows with information about the data), an extent, and navigation tools to pan and zoom. In general, the basemap and layers are hosted and shared through ArcGIS Online. However, maps can also contain layers added directly to the map and layers and basemaps referenced externally. Many maps also contain scaled symbols and other smart styling that reveal data and patterns as you interact with it.”

## Supported Data Type of ArcGIS Online
If you have privileges to create content, you can add many types of content as item to ArcGIS online. Please check the [ArcGIS online supported data file here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/supported-items.htm).

> - The most common data type that we use is Shapefile. If you have ArcGIS online organization account you can zip the shapefiles in a folder can upload the zip file to ArcGIS online account. If you have access to free public account, please convert your shapefile to other format such as KML or geoJSON before you upload them to ArcGIS online account.
