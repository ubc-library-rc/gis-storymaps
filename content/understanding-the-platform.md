# Understanding the ArcGIS Online platform  

ArcGIS Online is a cloud-based software that allows you to create and organize geospatial projects, which can come in the form of spatial narratives, data files created with desktop GIS applications, interactive web maps, dashboards, and more. Today's workshop will focus on the StoryMaps application, as well as the online mapping tool which we will use to make an interactive map we will then embed in our StoryMap. Understanding the workflow required to upload spatial data into ArcGIS online and create a basic visualization via the online mapping tools is an advantageous skill to have. Furthermore, any map you wish to include in your StoryMap, be it static or dynamic, must be prepared yourself. The only maps you can make from within StoryMaps are "map tours" where locations are selected to correspond to text and/or multimedia documentation. 

## ArcGIS Online's [StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)

[ArcGIS StoryMap](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/get-started/what-is-arcgis-storymaps.htm) is a web-based story authoring application that allows you to share your maps in the form of a multimedia narrative. StoryMaps are essentially single-page websites with embedded content. As you will see throughout this workshop, StoryMaps are pretty straightforward to make and can be a great presentation tool.



## ArcGIS Online's [Webmap](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-web-map.htm)

According to Esri: “An ArcGIS web map is an interactive display of geographic information that you can use to tell stories and answer questions…Maps contain a basemap, a set of data layers (many of which include interactive pop-up windows with information about the data), an extent, and navigation tools to pan and zoom. In general, the basemap and layers are hosted and shared through ArcGIS Online. However, maps can also contain layers added directly to the map and layers and basemaps referenced externally. Many maps also contain scaled symbols and other smart styling that reveal data and patterns as you interact with it.”

Although only limited analysis can be done with a free account, you can still create informative interactive maps with the online mapping tool. This workshop will show you today what's possible with a free account so you can make a decision as to whether this platform is best suited to what you want to do. Below is an example of the webmap we'll make.

## Why Choose ArcGIS Online?
 - No software install necessary
 - Don't have to know how to code
 - No server needed to host your published maps and data
 - Collaborate asynchronously on maps and share them via the web 
 - Easily embed web maps, StoryMaps, and other ArcGIS Online apps in external websites


## Supported Data Type of ArcGIS Online
The most common data type that we use is Shapefile. If you have ArcGIS online *organizational account*, you can zip the shapefiles in a folder and upload the zip file to your ArcGIS online account **Content**. Otherwise, if you only have access to *free public account*, convert your shapefiles to other geospatial file formats such as KML or geoJSON before uploading them. You can convert them inside a GIS, or using an online file converter. 

If you have privileges to create content, you can add many types of content as item to ArcGIS online. Please check the [ArcGIS online supported data file here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/supported-items.htm).
