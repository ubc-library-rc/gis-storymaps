# Next Steps
There are a lot of resources available to further explore ArcGIS Online, some of the themes we’ve explored in this workshop, and other Esri GIS software.

## Alternative platforms for narrative mapping
ArcGIS StoryMaps is not the only spatial narrative building platform. [Knightlab StoryMap](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) offers a free and open-source product to visualize spatial stories. Check out the Research Commons' [Telling Spatial Stories](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-spatial-stories/content/resources-narrative-mapping.html#knightlab-storymap) where we talk about Knightlab as an option. This workshop website is also an excellent resource if you're just beginning a project and want support evaluating different mapping platforms.
