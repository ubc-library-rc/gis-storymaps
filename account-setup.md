## ArcGIS Free vs. Enterprise Account
An ArcGIS free account can be created by anyone and is intended for noncommercial, nongovernmental use. When using ArcGIS StoryMaps with a public account, some advanced storytelling and customization features are not available, including:

- embedding web pages
- customizing story theme and logo
- Google analytics tracking ID
- including Audio
- image galleries
- timelines

You can still include images and video, embed map tours, and use the swipe tool. You can read more about features on the [ArcGIS Storymap Licensing page](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/reference/licensing.htm).

A free account on ArcGIS online does not allow you to do any spatial analysis on your web map like you could on a desktop GIS, however, it does allow styling, filtering, etc. By the end of this workshop you will have a better idea as to whether the free account meets your needs or not.
