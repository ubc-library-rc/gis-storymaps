# Creating StoryMaps with ArcGIS Online 

This workshop is a gentle introduction to creating StoryMaps using the ArcGIS Online platform. StoryMaps offer a low-barrier way to visualize spatial narratives that can be shared with your friends, community, or stakeholders. The StoryMaps interface is quite intuitive, with drag and drop options that result in an aesthetic output. No prior experience necessary. This workshop makes use of the **free** account option, though you are welcome to work within a personal or organizational account if you have a paid subscription.

By the end of this workshop, you will:

> - Know the differences between Public vs. Enterprise accounts for ArcGIS Online products, as well as be aware of the limitations of working with a free account
> - Gain basic familiarity with ArcGIS StoryMaps by exploring the interface and creating a StoryMap of your own
> - Learn how to add text, images, video, maps, and immersive content to a StoryMap
> - Understand the workflow of creating a web map with ArcGIS Online and embedding it in a StoryMap
> - Identify resources for future mapping projects
